# SignalframeUX — Design System for Culture Division

## Vision

A high-performance design system combining deterministic structure (FRAME) and generative expression (SIGNAL). Built for product design engineers who demand both precision and craft. The flagship implementation is a portfolio website that serves as both a case study and living reference.

## Product Type

Software — design system library + component library (TypeScript/React)

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Next.js 15.3 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **UI:** React, Tailwind CSS v4, CVA for variants, Radix UI via shadcn
- **Animation:** GSAP 3.12 + ScrollTrigger, Lenis smooth scroll
- **Design System:** SignalframeUX — housed at ~/code/projects/SignalframeUX
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Color Space:** OKLCH throughout

## Core Value

The dual-layer model: FRAME provides deterministic, legible, semantic structure. SIGNAL provides generative, parametric, animated expression. The signal runs through the frame.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Token system locked and enforced (spacing, typography, layout, colors, animation) — v1.0
- ✓ 5 SF layout primitives enforce tokens by construction (SFContainer, SFSection, SFStack, SFGrid, SFText) — v1.0
- ✓ SIGNAL layer authored with timing specs, CSS fallbacks, and mobile behavior definitions — v1.0
- ✓ Hero at 1440x900 is standalone SOTD jury moment with sub-500ms first motion — v1.0
- ✓ Crafted error/404 pages and 3 empty states as first-class design moments — v1.0
- ✓ Reduced-motion experience QA'd as intentional alternative design — v1.0
- ✓ DX contract: SCAFFOLDING.md, JSDoc 28/28 components, import boundary documented — v1.0
- ✓ Theme toggle GSAP guard prevents OKLCH/inline color conflicts — v1.0
- ✓ Singleton WebGL infrastructure (SignalCanvas, useSignalScene, color-resolve) — v1.1
- ✓ Multi-sensory SIGNAL activation: audio (Web Audio), haptics (Vibration API), idle animation — v1.1
- ✓ SignalMesh + TokenViz validate full generative pipeline under production conditions — v1.1
- ✓ GLSL procedural hero with integrated Bayer 4×4 ordered dither — v1.1
- ✓ All 5 pages consume SF layout primitives (32 SFSection instances, zero raw div wrappers) — v1.1
- ✓ [data-cursor] activated on all showcase sections — v1.1
- ✓ data-anim="stagger" on production grid blocks — v1.1
- ✓ Performance budget maintained with Three.js in async chunk (102 kB initial) — v1.1

### Active

- [ ] SignalMotion component placed on showcase sections (created but unused — INT-03 tech debt)
- [ ] SignalOverlay CSS var bridge to WebGL uniforms (one-sided wire — INT-04 tech debt)
- [ ] registry.json for AI/CLI component installation — DX-04
- [ ] createSignalframeUX(config) + useSignalframe() API — DX-05
- [ ] Session state persistence (filters, scroll, tabs) — STP-01

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — web-first, responsive design handles mobile
- Backend API — design system is frontend-only
- CMS integration — MDX + JSON for content
- React Three Fiber — excluded; R3F's independent rAF loop conflicts with GSAP globalTimeline.timeScale(0)
- Lottie — JSON-replayed animation, not generative/procedural; incompatible with DU/TDR aesthetic

## Current Milestone: v1.2 Tech Debt Sweep

**Goal:** Close all carried tech debt from v1.0 and v1.1 — wire unused components, fix type mismatches, ship deferred DX features, add session persistence, and clean up documentation.

**Target features:**
- Wire SignalMotion onto showcase sections (INT-03)
- Complete SignalOverlay→WebGL CSS var bridge with defaults (INT-04)
- Fix reference page layout gaps (INT-01)
- Fix SFSection bgShift prop type mismatch (bgShift)
- Ship registry.json for AI/CLI component installation (DX-04)
- Ship createSignalframeUX(config) + useSignalframe() API factory (DX-05)
- Add session state persistence for filters, scroll, tabs (STP-01)
- Clean up documentation frontmatters and stale checkboxes (Docs)

## Context

**Shipped v1.1 Generative Surface** (2026-04-06):
- 26 files modified, +2,388 lines across 20 feat commits
- Singleton WebGL infrastructure: SignalCanvas, useSignalScene, color-resolve with TTL cache
- Multi-sensory SIGNAL: audio feedback (Web Audio square wave), haptic feedback (Vibration API), idle animation (8s grain drift + OKLCH lightness pulse)
- Two generative scenes: SignalMesh (IcosahedronGeometry + vertex displacement) and TokenViz (Canvas 2D self-depicting visualization)
- GLSL procedural hero shader with FBM noise, geometric grid lines, and integrated Bayer 4×4 ordered dither
- SF layout primitives consumed across all 5 pages (32 SFSection instances)
- Three.js in async chunk (102 kB initial shared bundle)

**Shipped v1.0 Craft & Feedback** (2026-04-06):
- 115 files modified, +12,440 lines across 82 commits
- 29 SF-wrapped components (24 interactive + 5 layout primitives)
- Token system: 9 blessed spacing stops, 5 semantic typography aliases, 5 layout tokens, tiered color palette
- SIGNAL layer: ScrambleText, asymmetric hover (100ms/400ms), 34ms hard-cut, canvas cursor, stagger batch
- DX: SCAFFOLDING.md (337 lines), JSDoc coverage, DX-SPEC.md with deferred interface sketches

**Known tech debt (v1.1):**
- INT-03: SignalMotion component created but unused — needs placement on showcase sections
- INT-04: SignalOverlay writes CSS vars but no WebGL uniform reads them — one-sided bridge
- INT-04: --signal-* CSS vars have no defaults in globals.css
- SFSection bgShift boolean prop orphaned — all usage passes data-bg-shift as spread string

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Milestone | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Dual-layer FRAME/SIGNAL model | v1.0 | ✓ Good — clean separation of structure and expression |
| OKLCH color space throughout | v1.0 | ✓ Good — perceptually uniform, canvas bridge works via probe |
| Zero border-radius everywhere | v1.0 | ✓ Good — defines the DU/TDR industrial aesthetic |
| CVA `intent` as standard variant prop | v1.0 | ✓ Good — consistent API across all SF components |
| Deferred SIG-06/07/08 to post-v1.0 | v1.0 | ✓ Good — shipped in v1.1 with native APIs, zero dependencies |
| Server Components default for primitives | v1.0 | ✓ Good — no 'use client' on any layout primitive |
| Raw Three.js over React Three Fiber | v1.1 | ✓ Good — R3F's independent rAF conflicts with GSAP timeScale(0) |
| GSAP ticker as WebGL render driver | v1.1 | ✓ Good — single animation loop, reduced-motion kills everything |
| Single-pass GLSL hero with integrated dither | v1.1 | ✓ Good — avoided WebGLRenderTarget two-pass complexity |
| Document-level event listener for audio/haptics | v1.1 | ✓ Good — single listener vs modifying every SF component |
| pnpm over npm | v1.1 | ✓ Good — project convention, all plans auto-corrected |

## Constraints

- Lighthouse 100/100 all categories
- Dark mode primary, light mode available
- WCAG AA minimum, keyboard-navigable
- Page weight < 200KB initial (excluding images)
- LCP < 1.0s, CLS = 0, TTI < 1.5s
- Zero border-radius — DU/TDR industrial edges
- No generic dark-mode aesthetic — borrow directly from DU/TDR visual language

## Relationship to Culture Division

SignalframeUX is the design system for Culture Division. It powers the portfolio (first consumer), cdOS (internal tool, future), and CD-Operator (studio role, future).

- **Portfolio location:** ~/code/projects/portfolio (to be created)
